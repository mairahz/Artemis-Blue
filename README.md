## Project Overview
### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to build an outdoor GPS dead-reckoning with lorawan. It involves tracking a person using the Dragino Lorawan Module. A static beacon network will be created using the thing:52 for RSSI ranging and a dead-reckoning model with kalman filtering will be used. Lastly, a web dashboard viewer showing the current location will also be created. Scenarios that this project will be useful in would be for things such as tracking animals and tracking movements of a person.Â 

### Key Performance Indicator
The key performance indicators of the project would be:
1. Able to send gps location data, RSSI values and accelerometer data (longitude and latitude) from the mobile node to the LoRaWAN gps tracker
2. Having a web dashboard viewer showing the general location of the person
3. At least be able to track a person in a 10 x 10 m outdoor area
4. Able to send data from the LoRaWAN gps tracker to the LoRaWAN gateway
5. Dead-reckoning model with kalman filtering works and is able to narrow down location of a person

### Sensor Integration

### Wireless Network Integration
**Bluetooth network**
To facilitate RSSI ranging, the Thingy52 static nodes transmit bluetooth advertisements with the following payload format:

| Byte | 0 | 1 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Description | Preamble | Static Node ID |
| Value | 0b0011100 | e.g. 0x01 |

The Particle Argon scans for these advertisements as per the following message protocol diagram:

**LoRaWAN network**

GPS and RSSI and accelerometer data is sent to the LoRaWAN gateway via LoRaWAN as per the following payload formats and message protocol diagram:

**GPS and accelerometer data message payload (18 bytes)**

| Size (bytes) | 4 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Description | Latitude | Longitude | Alarm and battery | Flags | Roll | Pitch | HDOP | Altitude |

**RSSI data message payload (4 bytes)**

| Size (bytes) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Description | RSSI of Static Node 1 | RSSI of Static Node 2 | RSSI of Static Node 3 | RSSI of Static Node 4 |

### Algorithms
Dead-reckoning model with kalman filtering will be used to estimate the location of the mobile node. This is done by first having a known location of the node and then calculating an estimated location of the node by using the previous known location and the two rssi values received from the static nodes. In order to increase the accuracy of the estimated location, Kalman filter is then used.
